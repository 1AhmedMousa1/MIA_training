This was made using a markdown file to describe my repo and the projects in other branches 

## Task1
all of this task were made using C programming language

 1. Gru

 3. Task Manger

   > It has multipile options like

   - Adding tasks with a unique id 
   - veiwing tasks
   - removing tasks 

   ### Some code snippts ###
   ```py

   #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define MAX_TASKS 100

// Define a Task struct with an ID and description
typedef struct {
    int ID;
    char description[200];
}

int main() {
    Task tasks[MAX_TASKS];
    int numTasks = 0;
    int number;

    // Continuously prompt the user to select an action
    while (1) {
        printf("1.Add task \n");

        printf("Select action: ");
        scanf("%d", &number);
        system("cls");

        // Add code for each action here
    }
    return 0;
}
   
   ```
